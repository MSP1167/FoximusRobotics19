So, You need to update the camera. Great!
""s mean that it is a link or file in this folder

1. Make sure the newest version of the img is on the camera (1.11.0 as of 1/16/19, check "http://jevois.org/start/software.html" for updates)
2. If you dont already, dowload a software the can flash an .img file. I use Etcher ("https://www.balena.io/etcher/")
3. Plug the microsd card ("MicroSD.jpg") into your machine
4. After, select the img ("Select.png" and "Select1.png")
5. The drive should already be selected (Most likely D or E), if not, select it
6. Hit "Flash!" and wait it out. (Etcher will auto eject when done, Etcher also does a scan after flashing, so it will take double the first est time)
7. Make sure camera is plugged in, wait the ~15 seccond boot time, and enjoy!

Wait, We still need the other files. (This is the tedious stuff)

1. We will be using "BGR-To-HSV.py", "initscipt.cfg", "videomappings.cfg", and "script.cfg". "BGR-To-HSV.py" is the program, "initscipt.cfg" is for convienence on JeVois-Inventor,
"videomappings.cfg" sets up the correct size/framerate to brodcast, and "script.cfg" sets up the camera settings, such as exposure and gain.
2. Load up JeVois-Inventor (If you are not using JeVois-Inventor b/c linux, then navigate through the jevois folder that opens up when the microsd is plugged in)
3. Go to the config tab
4. Click on the dropdown and select initscript.cfg
5. In the bottom right, press "load from local"
6. Select the "initscript.cfg"
7. Click on the dropdown and select videomappings.cfg
8. In the bottom right, press "load from local"
9. Select the "videomappings.cfg"
10. Click on the dropdown and select script.cfg
11. In the bottom right, press "load from local"
12. Select the "script.cfg"
13. Click on the code tab
14. In the bottom right, press "load from local"
15. Select the "BGR-To-HSV.cfg"
16. In the bottom left, press Save To JeVois, and hit yes twice


CONGRATS! ITS NOW UP TO DATE!!!
